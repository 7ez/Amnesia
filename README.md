## How do I run Amnesia?
We offer multiple ways to get Amnesia running on your system!

### Using Releases
We upload a new release every time there is a major update to the project. These are pre-compiled executables that you can [download from the releases page](https://github.com/lenforiee/AmnesiaGUI/releases) and just simply run.

This is the method we recommend for the majority of users.

### Building From Source
Since Amnesia is an open source project, you may also compile the executables from the source code yourself.
To do so, you must first download and install the Go compiler. Then it is a matter of running the following commands:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lenforiee/AmnesiaGUI

# Go into directory
cd AmnesiaGUI

# Download the required modules
go get

# Compile the project executable
go build

# If you building on windows use this command to make console not appear
go build -ldflags -H=windowsgui
```

We only recommend this method for users interested in contributing to the project, or making small adjustments for themselves.
